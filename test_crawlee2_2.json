Introduction\n\nCoastal ecosystems, the dynamic interface between land and sea, are among the most productive and\nbiodiverse environments on Earth. They provide crucial ecosystem services, including coastal protection,\nfisheries, carbon sequestration, and support for a vast array of species. However, these vital\necosystems are increasingly threatened by the multifaceted impacts of climate change. Driven by\nanthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, climate change is manifesting in several interconnected ways\nthat are profoundly altering the physical and chemical conditions of coastal environments. This report\nwill delve into the key impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems, focusing on rising sea levels,\nocean acidification, and extreme weather events, and their specific consequences for critical habitats\nlike mangroves and coral reefs, and key organisms like shellfish and plankton. Understanding these\nimpacts is crucial for developing effective conservation and management strategies to mitigate the\ndamage and enhance the resilience of these invaluable ecosystems.\n\n2. Rising Sea Levels\n\nRising sea levels are a direct and significant consequence of global warming, driven by thermal\nexpansion of seawater and the melting of land ice (glaciers and ice sheets). This phenomenon poses a\ndirect threat to low-lying coastal ecosystems by inundating habitats, altering salinity regimes, and\nincreasing erosion rates. The rate of sea level rise is accelerating, and projections for the 21st\ncentury indicate a continued upward trend, with potentially devastating consequences for coastal\nenvironments.\n\n2.1. Impact on Mangroves\n\nMangrove forests are unique coastal ecosystems found in tropical and subtropical intertidal zones.\nThey provide numerous benefits, including coastal protection against storms, nursery grounds for\nfish and invertebrates, and significant carbon sequestration...\n<...>\n\n(gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25)"]]]}, "output": ["Title: Use Gemini thinking \u00a0|\u00a0 Gemini API \u00a0|\u00a0 Google AI for Developers", "\nCode Blocks:", "", "  1. ```\n      from google import genai\n\nclient = genai.Client(api_key=\"GEMINI_API_KEY\")\nprompt = \"Explain the concept of Occam's Razor and provide a simple, everyday example.\"\nresponse = client.models.generate_content(\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25\",  # or gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp\n    contents=prompt\n)\n\nprint(response.text)\n      ```", "  2. ```\n      import { GoogleGenAI } from \"@google/genai\";\n\nconst ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: \"GEMINI_API_KEY\" });\n\nasync function main() {\n  const prompt = \"Explain the concept of Occam's Razor and provide a simple, everyday example.\";\n\n  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n    model: \"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25\",  // or gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp\n    contents: prompt,\n  });\n\n  console.log(response.text);\n}\n\nmain();\n      ```", "  3. ```\n      // import packages here\n\nfunc main() {\n  ctx := context.Background()\n  client, err := genai.NewClient(ctx, option.WithAPIKey(os.Getenv(\"GEMINI_API_KEY\")))\n  if err != nil {\n    log.Fatal(err)\n  }\n  defer client.Close()\n\n  model := client.GenerativeModel(\"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25\")  // or gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp\n  resp, err := model.GenerateContent(ctx, genai.Text(\"Explain the concept of Occam's Razor and provide a simple, everyday example.\"))\n  if err != nil {\n    log.Fatal(err)\n  }\n  fmt.Println(resp.Text())\n}\n      ```", "  4. ```\n      curl \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:generateContent?key=$YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n -X POST \\\n -d '{\n   \"contents\": [\n     {\n       \"parts\": [\n         {\n           \"text\": \"Explain the concept of Occam\\''s Razor and provide a simple, everyday example.\"\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n   ]\n }'\n ```\n      ```", "  5. ```\n      from google import genai\n\nclient = genai.Client(api_key='GEMINI_API_KEY')\n\nchat = client.aio.chats.create(\n    model='gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25',  # or gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp\n)\nresponse = await chat.send_message('What is your name?')\nprint(response.text)\nresponse = await chat.send_message('What did you just say before this?')\nprint(response.text)\n      ```", "  6. ```\n      import { GoogleGenAI } from \"@google/genai\";\n\nconst ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: \"GEMINI_API_KEY\" });\n\nasync function main() {\n    const chat = ai.chats.create({\n        model: 'gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25'  // or gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp\n    });\n\n    const response = await chat.sendMessage({\n        message: 'What is your name?'\n    });\n    console.log(response.text);\n\n    response = await chat.sendMessage({\n        message: 'What did you just say before this?'\n    });\n    console.log(response.text);\n}\n\nmain();\n      ```", "\nTables:", "", "  Table 1:", "    Prompt:\n  What were the major scientific breakthroughs announced last week?\n  \n  Response (using Search Tool):\n  Based on recent search results, here are some highlights from the past week in science:\n\n...\n  \n  (gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25)", "  Table 2:", "    Prompt:\n  What is the sum of the first 50 prime numbers?\nGenerate and run Python code for the calculation, and make sure you get all 50.\nProvide the final sum clearly.\n  \n  Response (using Code Execution Tool):\n  Okay, I can calculate that.

However, the\ncapital was moved to Bras\u00edlia in 1960 as part of a plan to develop the country's interior and create\na more centrally located capital.\n\nVerification and Sources:\n\nYou can easily verify this information from numerous reliable sources:\n\nEncyclopedias:\n\nBritannica: Searching for \"Brazil\" on Britannica will clearly state Bras\u00edlia as the capital.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/place/Brazil (Look for the \"Capital\" information in the introductory summary or \"Geography\" section)\n\nWikipedia: The Wikipedia article for \"Brazil\" also states Bras\u00edlia as the capital.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil (Look in the infobox or introductory section)\n\nGovernment and Official Sources:\n\nCIA World Factbook: This is a highly reliable source for country information.

Introduction\n\nCoastal ecosystems, the dynamic interface between land and sea, are among the most productive and\nbiodiverse environments on Earth. They provide crucial ecosystem services, including coastal protection,\nfisheries, carbon sequestration, and support for a vast array of species. However, these vital\necosystems are increasingly threatened by the multifaceted impacts of climate change. Driven by\nanthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, climate change is manifesting in several interconnected ways\nthat are profoundly altering the physical and chemical conditions of coastal environments. This report\nwill delve into the key impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems, focusing on rising sea levels,\nocean acidification, and extreme weather events, and their specific consequences for critical habitats\nlike mangroves and coral reefs, and key organisms like shellfish and plankton. Understanding these\nimpacts is crucial for developing effective conservation and management strategies to mitigate the\ndamage and enhance the resilience of these invaluable ecosystems.\n\n2. Rising Sea Levels\n\nRising sea levels are a direct and significant consequence of global warming, driven by thermal\nexpansion of seawater and the melting of land ice (glaciers and ice sheets). This phenomenon poses a\ndirect threat to low-lying coastal ecosystems by inundating habitats, altering salinity regimes, and\nincreasing erosion rates. The rate of sea level rise is accelerating, and projections for the 21st\ncentury indicate a continued upward trend, with potentially devastating consequences for coastal\nenvironments.\n\n2.1. Impact on Mangroves\n\nMangrove forests are unique coastal ecosystems found in tropical and subtropical intertidal zones.\nThey provide numerous benefits, including coastal protection against storms, nursery grounds for\nfish and invertebrates, and significant carbon sequestration...\n<...>\n\n(gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25)"]}, "https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs": {"data": {"url":
